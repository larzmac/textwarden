# TextWarden — Larz's LanguageTool Fork

> **This is a personal fork of [PhilipSchmid/textwarden](https://github.com/PhilipSchmid/textwarden)**, built as a
> free replacement for a Grammarly subscription. Everything still runs locally — no accounts, no cloud, no cost.
>
> **What this fork adds** (branch `languagetool-engine`):
>
> - **LanguageTool engine** — grammar checking is powered by a local [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/dev)
>   server (`brew services start languagetool`, port 8081) for deeper rule coverage than Harper alone,
>   including homophone confusions like *their/they're*. `Sources/GrammarBridge/LanguageToolEngine.swift`
>   converts LT's UTF-16 offsets to the Unicode-scalar indices the app uses (emoji-safe, unit-tested).
> - **Automatic Harper fallback** — an `EngineRouter` prefers LanguageTool and silently falls back to the
>   built-in Harper engine when the server is down (30 s failure cooldown) or the document exceeds 20 k
>   characters. Engine picker in Settings → General (Auto / LanguageTool / Harper).
> - **Latency hardening for a network engine** — stale-result protection (generation counter +
>   text-identity guard so slow responses never misplace underlines), a content-keyed grammar result
>   cache (identical text skips the engine), and a 0.3 s debounce floor while LanguageTool is active.
> - **Companion browser extension** (`BrowserExtension/`) — a Manifest V3 WebExtension for Safari and
>   Chrome that checks web text fields in-page against the same local LanguageTool server, covering
>   web editors the macOS Accessibility API can't reach well.
> - **Statistical confused-word detection** — LanguageTool's 14 GB English n-gram data catches
>   correctly-spelled wrong words (*brakes/breaks*, *morning/mourning*) that pattern rules can't.
> - **Switchable AI rewrite engine** — style suggestions, rewrites, and sentence simplification can
>   run on **Apple Intelligence** (built-in) or a **local Ollama model** (Settings → Style → AI engine).
>   Both are fully on-device; there is no cloud path anywhere in this fork.
> - Fork housekeeping: upstream auto-update disabled, personal signing, OpenDirectory linked.
>
> **Full documentation of every change and the machine setup: [docs/FORK.md](docs/FORK.md).**
>
> Everything below this note is the original upstream README.

**Grammar checking that respects your privacy.**

TextWarden checks your spelling and grammar while you type - in any app on your Mac. Unlike other tools, everything runs locally on your computer. Your writing never leaves your device.

</p>

> [!NOTE]
> **Beta Software**: TextWarden is in active development and you may encounter bugs. For example, some visual underlines might be misaligned, some suggestions might not be perfect, or certain applications may not work as expected. Much like printers and projectors that still mysteriously fail on first try after decades of existence, macOS Accessibility APIs and the apps that implement them each have their own quirks that require app-specific tuning. That said, it should be stable enough for daily use and I'd love for you to try it! Your bug reports help make TextWarden better for everyone. Found something broken? [Report it here](#support).

## Why TextWarden?

**Private by Design**
Your text stays on your Mac. No cloud servers, no accounts, no data collection. Works completely offline.

**Blazingly Fast**
Powered by [Harper](https://github.com/automattic/harper), a high-performance Rust-based grammar engine.

**Works Everywhere**
Integrates with most macOS apps through the Accessibility API - Mail, Outlook, Teams, Slack, and more.

**Simple and Unobtrusive**
A small indicator and/or underline appears when issues are found. Click to see suggestions. Accept with one click. That's it.

## Features

- **Real-time grammar and spelling** - Catches errors as you type
- **AI-powered style suggestions** - Apple Intelligence ([Foundation Models](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/FoundationModels)) for clarity and readability improvements (macOS 26+)
- **AI Compose** - Generate text from instructions using on-device AI (macOS 26+, Apple Silicon)
- **Sketch Pad** - A built-in writing environment with full AI integration (see [Sketch Pad](#sketch-pad))
- **Readability Score** - Real-time Flesch Reading Ease score for text with 30+ words
- **Multilingual awareness** - Detects non-English documents and sentences, skipping grammar checks (no false positives on foreign text)
- **Custom dictionary** - Add your own technical terms and proper nouns
- **Dialect support** - American, British, Canadian, Australian, or Indian English
- **App controls** - Enable, disable, or pause checking per application
- **Automatic updates** - Stay current with optional update checks

## Requirements

- macOS 26 (Tahoe) or later
- Any Mac that supports macOS 26 (Intel or Apple Silicon)

> **Note for Intel Mac users**: TextWarden runs on Intel Macs, but **AI-powered style suggestions are not available**. Apple Intelligence requires Apple Silicon (M1 or later) due to the Neural Engine hardware. Grammar and spelling checking work fully on Intel Macs.

## Getting Started

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/philipschmid/textwarden/releases)
   - The DMG is a **Universal binary** that works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
2. Move TextWarden to your Applications folder and open it
3. Grant Accessibility permission when prompted (required to read text in other apps)
4. **Recommended**: Disable built-in spell/grammar checking in apps you use with TextWarden to avoid confusion from overlapping underlines (e.g., in System Settings → Keyboard → Text Input, or within individual apps like Slack, Word, etc.)
5. Start typing - TextWarden works automatically in the background

For detailed explanations of all settings and how they affect your experience, see the **[Configuration Guide](CONFIGURATION.md)**.

## Feature Details

### Real-Time Grammar and Spelling

TextWarden continuously monitors your writing and highlights errors as you type. Corrections appear in a popover with one-click apply. Supported error categories include:

- Spelling mistakes and typos
- Grammar errors (subject-verb agreement, tense, etc.)
- Punctuation issues
- Capitalization errors
- Word choice and commonly confused words
- Redundant phrases

You can enable or disable specific categories in Settings.

### AI-Powered Style Suggestions

Beyond rule-based grammar checking, TextWarden offers intelligent style suggestions powered by Apple Intelligence running entirely on your Mac. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled in Settings → Style.

When enabled, style checking runs automatically after grammar analysis with smart rate limiting. You can also trigger it manually:

- **Keyboard shortcut**: Press `Option+Control+S` (customizable) to run a style check on demand
- **Indicator click**: Click or hover over the style section of the capsule indicator

When using the keyboard shortcut with text selected, only the selected portion is analyzed. Without a selection, the entire text field is analyzed.

Available writing styles: Default, Concise, Formal, Casual, and Business.

### AI Compose

AI Compose lets you generate text directly from natural language instructions. Click the pen icon on the indicator (when style checking is enabled) to open the compose panel.

Use cases:
- Draft emails, messages, or responses
- Expand bullet points into full paragraphs
- Rewrite or rephrase selected text
- Generate placeholder content

Enter your instruction (e.g., "Write a polite decline for a meeting invitation"), choose a writing style, and press Enter. The generated text can be inserted directly or copied to clipboard. Use "Retry" to get alternative versions.

Like style suggestions, AI Compose runs entirely on-device using Apple Intelligence - your instructions and generated text never leave your Mac.

### Sketch Pad

Sketch Pad is TextWarden's built-in writing environment - a dedicated space where you can write, edit, and refine text with full access to all AI features. Open it from the menu bar icon or use the keyboard shortcut.

**Why use Sketch Pad?**

- **Full AI integration** - Grammar checking, style suggestions, readability analysis, and AI-powered quick actions (Professional, Friendly, Concise, Refine) all in one place
- **Works with any text** - Draft content for any application, then copy it where you need it
- **Universal solution** - Perfect for applications that TextWarden doesn't yet support or where accessibility integration is limited
- **Distraction-free** - A clean, focused writing space with real-time feedback

Sketch Pad gives you all of TextWarden's capabilities in a standalone window, making it ideal when you need to compose longer content or work with applications that don't fully support macOS Accessibility APIs.

### Multilingual Support

TextWarden uses document-level and sentence-level language detection to avoid false positives when you write in other languages. If more than 60% of a document is detected as German, Spanish, or another non-English language, all grammar checking is skipped for that document. For mixed-language documents, each sentence is analyzed independently - foreign-language sentences have their errors suppressed while English sentences are still checked. This handles both fully foreign documents and emails that include phrases like "Freundliche Grüsse" or "Merci beaucoup".

Supported languages for detection: Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hindi, Turkish, Swedish, and Vietnamese.

### App and Website Controls

Control exactly where TextWarden runs:

- Enable or disable checking for specific applications
- Pause checking temporarily (1 hour, 24 hours, or indefinitely)
- Disable checking for specific websites when using browsers

### Additional Features

- **Custom dictionary** - Add technical terms, proper nouns, or specialized vocabulary
- **Dialect support** - American, British, Canadian, Australian, or Indian English spelling rules
- **Internet abbreviations** - Recognizes "btw", "afaik", "imo" without flagging them
- **IT terminology** - Built-in dictionary of 10,000+ technical terms and company names
- **Brand names** - 2,400+ company/brand names (Fortune 500, Forbes 2000, global brands)
- **Person names** - 100,000+ international first names (US SSA + worldwide sources)
- **Surnames** - 150,000+ last names from US Census data
- **Usage statistics** - Track errors found and corrections applied (stored locally)
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - Customizable shortcuts for common actions
- **Menu bar integration** - Quick access to pause, resume, and settings
- **Launch at login** - Optionally start TextWarden when you log in

### Automatic Updates

TextWarden can automatically check for updates and notify you when a new version is available. Enable automatic update checks in Settings → Advanced.

To receive early access to new features, enable the **experimental channel** in Settings. This includes alpha, beta, and release candidate versions.

## Known Limitations

TextWarden is a privacy-focused, local-first tool with certain trade-offs:

- **macOS only** - Available for Intel and Apple Silicon Macs running macOS 26+. There are no plans to support Windows or Linux - approximately 98% of TextWarden's development effort goes into macOS-specific integration: precise cursor positioning via the Accessibility API, pixel-perfect error underline placement, seamless text replacement that preserves formatting, and per-application behavior tuning. These deep OS integrations don't translate to other platforms.
- **Style suggestions require Apple Silicon** - AI-powered style suggestions use Apple Intelligence, which requires the Neural Engine in M1 chips or later. Intel Macs can use all grammar and spelling features but won't have access to style suggestions.
- **English only** - Grammar checking limited to English (Harper's current language support)
- **Accessibility API constraints** - Some apps with custom text rendering may not work correctly
- **Text formatting** - When applying corrections in some apps, formatting (bold, italic) may not be preserved
- **Visual underlines** - Not all applications support visual error underlines; see [Tested Applications](#tested-applications) for details and the [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#visual-underlines-appear-misaligned) for help

### Looking for More?

If you need cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, iOS, Android), grammar checking in languages other than English, consider:

- **[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com)** - Excellent product with broad application support and a refined user experience developed over many years
- **[LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/)** - "Open-source" grammar checker with support for 30+ languages, available as browser extensions and desktop apps

TextWarden focuses specifically on privacy, local processing, and full transparency as an open-source project - which comes with the trade-offs mentioned above.

## Privacy

TextWarden never sends your text anywhere. All grammar checking and style analysis happens on-device using Harper (grammar) and Apple Intelligence (style suggestions). Block TextWarden in your firewall and it works exactly the same (except for automatic update checks).

## AI Declaration

The majority of TextWarden's code was generated using Anthropic's Claude, with human oversight, review, and testing throughout the development process.

The TextWarden logo was created with [Recraft](https://www.recraft.ai/) - an amazing AI image generation tool with background removal, image vectorization, and more. Highly recommended for creating app icons and design assets.

## Credits

### Harper - The Grammar Engine

TextWarden is powered by [Harper](https://writewithharper.com/), an open-source grammar checker built in Rust by Automattic. Harper is what makes TextWarden fast and private - it runs entirely on your device without sending text to any server.

If you need grammar checking **inside your browser** with full support for rich text editors, form fields, and web apps, check out [Harper's Chrome Extension](https://writewithharper.com/). Unlike TextWarden (which uses macOS Accessibility APIs from outside the browser), Harper's extension runs directly in the browser with full DOM and JavaScript access - this means better integration with complex web applications like Google Docs, Gmail compose, and other rich text editors.

### VoiceInk - Voice-to-Text

I used [VoiceInk](https://tryvoiceink.com?atp=Ylsxyh&sub1=tw) extensively while developing TextWarden. It saved me countless hours by letting me dictate AI prompts, documentation, and commit messages instead of typing everything. Like TextWarden, it runs entirely locally on your Mac. *(Referral link - helps support TextWarden's development)*

### Tested Applications

TextWarden uses the macOS Accessibility API and works with most applications. Visual underlines (showing errors directly in the text) have been specifically tested and calibrated for:

| Application | Grammar Checking | Visual Underlines |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Slack** | Full | Full |
| **Claude** | Full | Full |
| **ChatGPT** | Full | Full |
| **Perplexity** | Full | Full |
| **Safari** | Full | Full |
| **Chrome, Comet** | Full | Full |
| **Apple Mail** | Full | Full |
| **Apple Notes** | Full | Full |
| **Apple Messages** | Full | Full |
| **Apple Calendar** | Full | Full |
| **Apple Pages** | Full | Full |
| **Apple Reminders** | Full | Full |
| **TextEdit** | Full | Full |
| **Notion** | Full | Partial** |
| **Telegram** | Full | Full |
| **WhatsApp** | Full | Full |
| **Webex** | Full | Full |
| **Microsoft Word** | Full | Full |
| **Microsoft PowerPoint** | Notes only* | Notes only* |
| **Microsoft Outlook** | Full | Full |
| **Microsoft Excel** | Not supported | N/A |
| **Microsoft Teams** | Full | Full |
| **Proton Mail** | Full | Full |

*\*PowerPoint exposes only the Notes section via the macOS Accessibility API. Slide text boxes are not accessible programmatically (Microsoft limitation), so grammar checking and visual underlines are limited to speaker notes. See [PowerPoint documentation](docs/applications/POWERPOINT.md) for details.*

*\*\*Notion: Underlines appear for ~50% of text blocks. Due to Notion's React/Electron virtualization, some blocks aren't exposed in the accessibility tree. Errors in virtualized blocks show in the indicator count but without underlines. Shift+Enter (soft breaks) work; Enter (new blocks) may not. See [Notion documentation](docs/applications/NOTION.md) for details.*

> [!NOTE]
> Terminal apps are not supported as their accessibility APIs typically don't expose text content in a way that's useful for grammar checking.

**Other applications**: TextWarden works with most apps that support standard text editing. Grammar checking and the floating error indicator work broadly; visual underlines may vary. [Request support](https://github.com/philipschmid/textwarden/discussions) for additional apps.
